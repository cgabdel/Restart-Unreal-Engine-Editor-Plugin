I downloaded the [4.25 Version from the UE Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/restart-editor) since the latest update was more than a year ago.

I also changed the default restart shortcut from **CTRL-SHIFT-R** to **CTRL-ALT-R** to avoid conflict with the default "Refresh Code Project" command
